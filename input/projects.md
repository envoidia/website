I've made many projects over the years. Here are the ones that I feel deserve showcasing

<?# YouTube 4zi9IeLwuN0 /?>

Development started: 1 Jul 2025; Release: TBD; Last updated: Probably within the last few days

A strategy-focused turn-based RPG where you train monsters to fight for you, with perfect information and no RNG or

development, but progress is good
