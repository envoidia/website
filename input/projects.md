<?# YouTube 4zi9IeLwuN0 /?>

Development started: 1 Jul 2025; Release: TBD; Last updated: Probably within the last few days

A strategy-focused turn-based RPG where you train monsters to fight for you, with perfect information and no RNG or
grinding. Features a story about how trauma influences your perception, how much pain you'll put up with to love
someone, what it means to be "special", and how to keep on living when nothing matters anymore. Very early in
development, but progress is good

A massive GregTech 1.12 addon that adds several new tiers of advanced endgame progression, technology, and machines.
Unfinished, but mostly complete. Completion is dependent on features from a not-yet-released update to base GregTech

# Older Games (mostly bad)

## [Touhou Slightly Greater-than-usual Fairy](https://www.bulletforge.org/u/arkeeneum/p/touhou-slightly-greater-than-usual-fairy)

Development started: ~Jul 2020; Release: 09 Sep 2020

My first finished, released Touhou fangame, featuring Daiyousei as an extra stage boss. It's not very good, but it's
surprisingly playable

## [Vast Mugenri](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vast-mugenri)

Development started: 7 Nov 2020; Release: 3 Dec 2020; Last updated: 2 Apr 2022

A Minecraft mod that adds numerous items and structures based off of the Len'en Project

## [Touhou Everything Bleeding Away](https://www.bulletforge.org/u/arkeeneum/p/touhou-everything-bleeding-away)

Development started: ~10 Sep 2020; Release: 07 Jan 2021

A Touhou fangame featuring a single stage with random enemy patterns/midbosses and a movement system (the same as the
one in Len'en 4 \~ Brilliant Pagoda or Haze Castle), with 3 bosses depending on the route you take. Also not very good

## **東方漸崩霊**

Development started: ~12 Jan 2021, Release: 27 Feb 2021

A final boss fight against Kisume, made in about 6 weeks for a game jam. The first game I ever made that I think could
genuinely be considered "good". It's not something I would say you should go out of your way to play, as it's nothing
special, but if you do, you'll probably have fun

## [Touhou Remnant Mind](https://eln-sf.itch.io/remnant-mind)

Development started: 12 Oct 2021; Release: 12 Oct 2021

A deliberately bad Touhou fangame I made in just a few hours

## One Last Light

Release: ~2018

A turn-based RPG coded entirely in Windows Command Prompt, based off of an existing one called LEGEND. It's really bad
and mostly nonfunctional

## Diatrixia

Release: ~Jan 2020

A Minecraft mod I made using a tool called Additions, which is kind of like MCreator but entirely in-game and even
worse. It just added a bunch of random crap that I thought was cool back then. It's not good

# Abandoned Games

~2018-2019, I began and promptly dropped development on numerous games similar to One Last Light, many of which would
have had much higher quality had they been finished\
The last and highest quality of them was called LANDSEND. It's still bad, though

~2020, I began and promptly dropped development on numberous Touhou fangames and one Len'en fangame

From Sep 2022 to ~Aug 2023, I worked on Luxite, which was a GregTech-like mod for modern versions of Minecraft. It was
going to have a much larger scale and a much higher degree of complexity than GregTech. I dropped because my
then-partner was doing most of the coding, as I didn't know Java at the time, and she got burnt out and dropped the
project. That being said, even if she had kept going, I don't think I would have finished it, as I eventually realized
that the higher complexity was not to the mod's benefit, at least in my opinion. No doubt many people would have found
it fun for the same reason they find Gregicality fun, but it wouldn't have been something I personally would have
enjoyed actually playing

From 18 Sep 2024 to 3 Oct 2024, I worked on [a modular tools mod](https://github.com/envoidia/YAMTM) for modern versions
of Minecraft. I dropped it because working with modern Minecraft's code is absolutely horrible and everything is way
more complicated than it needs to be

I've worked on numerous other projects that I ended up dropping so quickly that they're not even worth mentioning here.
Most of them got some design docs and assets, the tiniest bit of nonfunctional code, and then nothing
