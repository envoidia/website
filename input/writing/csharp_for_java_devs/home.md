This is a set of documents I made explaining differences between Java and C# to help myself migrate

It is not exhaustive nor does it make any guarantee of accuracy

It will be assumed that you know Java to a decent extent

These docs are written for .NET 10, which as of this writing is the latest version

If you want to make a game with C#, I recommend [MonoGame](https://monogame.net/). If you prefer something with a visual
editor, try [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
