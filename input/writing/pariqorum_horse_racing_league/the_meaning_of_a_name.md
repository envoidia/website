## Chapter 5: The Meaning of a Name

### Planet Konjneta

### Unknown Location

### Saturday, 11:15

\--------

A gleaming silver indoor racetrack, windowless and lit only by long LED strips installed on the edges of the room,
seemingly completely deserted except for two figures locked in an intense battle, racing side-by-side.

One figure, a shining white. The other, a vibrant cyan.

“Something…isn’t…right…”, white proclaims, panting between every word as she pushes her body to its limit. “I don’t…want
to…win…like this.”

“Then don’t.” Cyan’s voice is fierce and harsh, a fire burning inside her the likes of which white hadn’t seen before.
“Let me…have this.”

Cyan pulls ahead, gaining a sizable lead in mere seconds as white slows down.

*Maybe I should let her win*, white thinks as she watches cyan take the lead, *clearly a win would mean more to her than
to me. There’s something up with this race anyway…*

Cyan pulls into the final clearing. The finish carrot is in sight, closer than it’s been to her since all the way back
at Dullahan Park, when it was taken from her at the last moment. But this time will be different. This time, yellow
isn’t here to take it away from her. Merry isn’t here to deliver her false promises. This time-

“I’m sorry, cyan…”

Tears streaming down her face, white appears from behind cyan, taking the lead at the last second, and stealing the win
from her once again before collapsing on the floor, crying. Cyan trips and falls directly into white’s arms, beginning
to cry as well. The two lay there for a moment, the only sound being each other’s sobbing.

White turns her head and looks behind the goal. It’s a new jersey for her, gleaming white, with the name “SUP”
emblazoned across the front.

“Has…this always been here?”, white inquires, confused.

She picks up the jersey, turning it over to see that the back reads “Superstitional Realism” in smaller lettering.

Cyan sniffles, wiping away her tears and sitting up, awkwardly pushing herself away from Super’s grasp.

“Don’t you get it? They knew you’d win. They’ve always known. This isn’t real.”

Super looks around at the barren, empty room.

“Yeah...this is really suspicious.”

Cyan shakes her head.

“No. Not just this. It’s never been real. It’s-” Cyan hesitates mid-sentence, suddenly seeming terrified to continue.

“It’s what?”, urges Super.

Cyan closes her eyes, beginning to cry once more.

“Nothing. I shouldn’t have said anything. Congratulations on your win, Super.”

“I didn’t want to win like this. I’m sorry. I should have let you have it.”

“Well, then I wouldn’t have earned it either.”

“I know, I just...you deserve a break.”

“I’m not going to get one. That’s how it’s supposed to be.”

“Listen, cyan, next time I get a chance to, I’m gonna help you win, okay? It’s the least I can do for you.”

Cyan laughs. An empty, cold laugh, the laugh of someone that has nothing left to hope for anymore.

“Yeah,” cyan sighs, “I’ve heard that one before.”
