“Hey, uh, Handler, can I talk to you for a second?”

“Shoot.” Valerie doesn’t even look up from her phone at brown, who earned the name Door Knob five weeks ago.

“It’s just…” Knob hesitates.

“Spit it out, we ain’t got all day.”

“You know that uh…” Knob’s voice drops to a harsh whisper. “*stuff* you gave me?”

“Yes. It was expensive. And you didn’t want it. And now at this rate the only horse good enough to even qualify for
Colorline, much less win it, is gonna be Merry.”

“Uh...I checked on it the other day and...it’s empty.”

Valerie suddenly looks up from her phone, turning her neck so fast you’d think she’d get whiplash.

“What did you just say.”

Knob winces.

“It’s empty, Handler.”

The two stare at each other in silence for a moment before a simple question crosses Valerie’s lips.

“Was it you?”

She already knew the answer.

“No, Handler.”

“I…” Valerie hesitates, seeming as though she’s choosing her words carefully for the first time in a very long time.
“Need to make some calls. You just focus on the race, okay?”

“Understood,” states Knob as she begins her slow walk towards the starting gate.

Crouched behind a nearby garbage can, a figure obscured in shadow swallows nervously, something about what they just
overheard greatly bothersome to them.

“And now it is with great pleasure that I introduce the racers for today’s Amplus Gold Cup! There’s yellow and gray,
still striving to earn their names! Bullet’n Board, the blue horse! Door Knob, the brown horse! Jovial Merryment, the
orange horse, who just can’t stop winning! And lastly, two newcomers, red and pink! Who knows what they could bring to
the table?”

A faint rapping on the door of the dark room.

“It’s open,” the old woman croaks.

The door opens, and a nervous-looking young man dressed in a butler’s uniform steps into the room.

“Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Meadows-”

“Please,” the woman seems amused, “Mrs. Meadows was my mother. Call me Ivy.”

The man seems taken aback, but gathers himself and continues.

“Your daughter is here to see you. She said it’s important, and that she can’t say it over the phone.”

Ivy chuckles.

“Tell her I already know what it is.”

“B-but Mrs, I mean Ivy-”

“No buts. Just tell her that I already know, and I’m working on it. She can come in if she wants, but she really should
be at the race, letting me worry about this stuff.”

The man nods.

“Understood.”

The door closes with a click as Ivy dials a number on her phone. It’s picked up on the first ring.

“We’re not the only ones who know.”

The room falls silent except for the muffled sounds of the television, its pale flickering light illuminating Ivy’s face
as she intently listens to what the other side has to say.

“Hey, where are white and cyan?”, yellow asks as she looks around.

Alexis smirks and glances towards the newcomers.

“Guess they got replaced since they didn’t have what it takes.” She leans in close to yellow, who begins to tremble. “If
you don’t start winning soon, they might replace you too.”

Seeming satisfied with yellow’s response, Alexis backs off and walks away as yellow approaches the starting gate.

Red. Yellow. Green. And the race begins once again.

Approaching the first corner, yellow finds herself in the lead. She turns to see red catching up to her.

“Hey,” she says, trying to be friendly. Red doesn’t even look at her.

*The super-serious type, huh?*, yellow thinks, *Well, two can play at that game.*

Yellow smirks and renews her efforts, regaining the lead once more. From the stands, Alexis smiles, seeming almost
surprised.

*This is gonna be my race, for real this time. I’m gonna get my name, and Handler is finally gonna respect me. Everyone
will respect me.*

“Fancy seein’ ya here.”

A confident voice from beside yellow snaps her out of her thoughts. Of course, it’s Merry.

“You’re not gonna beat me this time, Merry.”

“Oh?” Merry seems amused. She reaches out and gently brushes yellow’s cheek without missing a step. “I like your
attitude.”

“Ah- Wha-”, yellow exclaims, clearly startled. “What are you-”

“Doing?” Merry smirks. “Why, winning, of course.”

Yellow redirects her attention back to the race, realizing that they’ve reached the final bend just as Merry pulls
ahead, snatching victory from right under her hooves yet again. Defeated, yellow collapses on the ground, inches from
the finish.

*What is that girl’s problem? She makes winning look so easy, and why is she messing with me? She could have just
tripped me, and it would have been easier for both of us. Does she think it’s funny? Does she think this is a game? What
does she want from me? It’s so confusing-*

“The least you could have done is take second.” Alexis’ harsh tone snaps yellow out of her thoughts.

“Agh- I’m...sorry.”, yellow gasps, panting for breath.

Alexis sighs.

“Sometimes, I feel like I picked the wrong pony.” With those harsh words, she turns and walks away, motioning for yellow
to follow her.

Weakly, yellow stands up, wobbling slightly before gaining her balance. She brushes her hand across her face, and a few
loosened teardrops fly across the track, splattering on the dirt.

*I’m a failure.*
