Red light. Yellow light. Green light. The oh-so-familiar clattering of metal. Let another race begin, just as it has so
many times before. But this time, something is different.

The track is a dark labyrinth, dimly light by glowing red strips across the floor. The racers are all unrecognizable,
misshapen figures, most of which seem barely able to hold their own weight, barely aware that they’re in a race.

From the second level of the building, two figures watch the proceedings unfold.

“Most of them won’t do.” One of the figures is Ivy, and her voice shatters the tense silence. “But I have my eye on a
few of them.”

The man beside her, clad in a lab coat, holding a clipboard filled with papers, looks uncertain. “Horses aren’t made to
race for more than a season. Are you sure about this?”

Ivy grins as she watches one of the horses reach the finish. It’s larger than a normal horse, and its fur is bright
white, its deteriorating veins bulging all over its body.

“Let’s just say I have a good feeling about some of the old guard. What remains of them, anyway” She turns to her
compatriot. “Now then, subject C7C has earned a name, don’t you agree?”

The trials continue for what feels like forever, the horses, if they can even be called that anymore, ran ragged, until
finally, another one of them happens to stumble its way to the finish carrot.

One of the scientists flips through his clipboard, a perturbed look on his face.

“Why in the world are there two subject 006s? And why can’t I find any mention of the second one in our records?”

“Must have been some record-keeping error,” responds Ivy, nonchalantly. “The lighter blue one of them just won, so it’s
getting a name anyway.”

“Aaand subject 003 wins.” The scientist sighs. “Are we done now, Mrs. Meadows? We’ve been here for ages.”

Ivy smiles, warmly yet somehow eerily.

“Mrs. Meadows was my mother. But yes, we’re done. Good work today.”

A ringing sound echoes through the room. It’s Ivy’s phone. She reaches into her pocket and picks it up. The screen reads
“Kate”.

“Ah, it’s my daughter. I should take this. Excuse me for a moment.” Ivy begins to walk away, but hesitates and turns
back for a moment. “Oh, and one last thing. Just get rid of the ones that didn’t win today. They won’t be useful to us
anymore.”

The scientist nods.

“Understood,” he hesitates for a moment before continuing, “Ivy.”

She smiles at him and walks away, putting her phone to her ear.
