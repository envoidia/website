“Agh…”, cyan winces as she sits up, grasping her head with both hands.

*What a terrible headache.*

She looks around. She’s in another windowless indoor racetrack, the walls gleaming silver, standing directly behind the
starting gate. But something’s off about this track. It’s just a straight shot to the finish, and incredibly short to
boot.

*How did I get here?*, she wonders. *The last thing I remember is…oh. Right. I decided I was going to tell on Merry for
cheating. And on myself, since it’s my fault that she is…*

Cyan grasps onto the starting gate and pulls herself to her feet. She winces as she places weight on her left ankle.

*When did I injure my ankle…?*

She leans against the wall to keep her balance, unable to stand on her injured ankle. Suddenly, a harsh green light
illuminates her face. She winces from the sudden brightness, shielding her eyes as she looks up at the starting lights.
The green one turned on, but why?

Then, the yellow one.

*No way...am I seriously so pathetic that they have me racing myself now?*

Then, the red one.

And at last, after what feels like an eternity, the starting gate opens with a clatter of metal, and, as if
instinctively, cyan runs forward just as she has so many times before, tripping on her injured ankle and falling flat on
her face, bleeding from her lip from the impact.

*I’m not going to fail to reach the finish again, even when I’m all alone. I couldn’t live with myself after that.*

Cyan attempts to stand up for a moment, before deciding that it’s better to drag herself across the floor. Inch by inch,
she slowly approaches the finish carrot. It seems to sparkle ethereally in the harsh lighting of the room, as if
taunting her to come and get it.

Looking at it, she can almost see Merry’s face, laughing at her. Super’s face, looking sorry for her. Lydia’s face,
clearly having given up on her. This is her chance to prove them all wrong. To prove that she does have what it takes.
Even if alone, a race won is a race won. And a name is a name. Enough to stop being treated like an object at least.

It’s almost within reach. Just like it has been so many times before. And this time, no one can take it from her. Cyan
pants and wheezes as she drags herself towards the finish. Towards recognition, respect, becoming more than a
laughingstock. Towards having deserved to be born.

At least, she reaches at, and swipes at the carrot. It wobbles for a moment, before finally toppling. It seems to take
an eternity to hit the floor as cyan watches intently, with bated breath. The harsh lighting sears itself into cyan’s
eyes as she stares at the carrot that will finally let her make a name for herself.

After what felt like an eternity, the carrot hits the floor. The cacophony of the impact seems enough to drown out even
thoughts. It rolls slightly before coming to a stop. And at last, everything is still, as if afraid to break this sacred
silence.

After taking a moment to rest, cyan spots a glimmer of something her-colored waiting behind the carrot.

*That must be my new jersey, with my new name. Proof that I’m worth something.*

More excited than she’s ever been, cyan drags herself over to it, eager to read what it says.

It reads “CYN”. Cyan.

Cyan’s head collapses into the jersey, muffling the sound of her sobbing as her tears dampen it.

*Sick joke. But no one’s laughing.*

The room lays still for another eternity. Only the low hum of the lights and the faint sound of cyan crying can be
heard.

Eventually, cyan hears something. It sounds like someone’s voice, coming from the top of a nearby ladder. She drags
herself out of her puddle of tears over to the ladder. With her injured ankle, climbing it is very difficult and slow,
but she manages, step by step, until she reaches the top, unable to believe what she’s seeing.

It’s a screen. And it’s displaying a race from above, a man’s voice emanating from it.

“I can’t believe what I’m seeing folks, Jovial Merryment and yellow seem to be locked in a, uh...thing at the back, not
even trying to win, as Resolute Mind Afternoon and Downtown Skybox battle it out! What an upset for everyone thinking
Merry was a sure thing, eh? And it looks like Door Knob has taken the lead; it seems this race is just about over
already!”

Slowly, cyan looks up, towards the ceiling of the room. A camera. Silently, she turns her head down, her hair falling in
front of her face, obscuring her expression.

“So…”, cyan says, speaking out loud for the first time in a while, her voice raspy from so much crying. “In the end,
it’s always been a game. And now I know too much.”
