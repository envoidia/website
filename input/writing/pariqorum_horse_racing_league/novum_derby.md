“I can’t believe we’re really going to be racing at the Millennium Kilometer!”, yellow exclaims, excitedly, as she looks
out the window of the hotel the racers are staying in. “You know, this was just built, like, late last year.”

Alexis doesn’t look up from her phone.

“This is a really nice hotel, too!”, yellow continues. “I dunno why, but I have a good feeling about this race. It just
feels right.”

“I should hope so,” Alexis states, dryly, gaze still fixated on her phone. “You haven’t won a race since Redgrass, after
all.”

“But, Handler, there have only been five races so far. The only one with more than one win is blue.”

“Yes, and it should have been you. Now get some rest; the race is tomorrow, after all.”

Yellow sighs.

“Of course, Handler. Good night.”

Alexis doesn’t respond.

Saturday, 14:00

“Um, hey, gray?” Brooke and gray turn to see Kate standing behind them. “Not to rush you or anything, but the race is
about to start, so you should probably head to the gate…”

“Right, sorry.” Before leaving, gray turns to Brooke. “I’ve got this.” Brooke simply smiles at her.

Gray arrives at the gate to find everyone else already waiting there.

“What took you so long?”, orange inquires.

“Was just talking to my Handler about some stuff.”

“You mean the race?”

“I mean, yeah, but other things too.”

“Your Handler talks to you about stuff other than racing?” Orange seems confused.

“Uh...yeah? Is that not normal…?”

“I…” orange hesitates before continuing. “Don’t think it is?”

Before either can say another word, a red light illuminates the racers. The race is beginning. Yellow. Green. The metal
clatter of the gates all opening rapidly. And, in the blink of an eye, the horses have all disappeared from the starting
gate, as if they were never there.

\--------

“White breaks off from the pack and gives herself a huge lead! She’s been so close to winning so many times and never
gotten there, but with a lead like that, maybe this will be the one! Yellow follows in second, and the rest of the pack
is all clumped together. It’s looking like this might just be a landslide victory for white as gray and orange close in
on yellow, poor cyan stuck in last, she hasn’t been able to catch a break ever since her narrow loss at Redgrass back in
Porekla. Orange is catching up to white, and- and I don't believe it folks, but cyan has caught up! It’s orange and cyan
battling for the lead! Cyan is in the lead and it’s a straight shot to the finish! Has she finally done it? …No! She
trips and drops to dead last as orange very narrowly beats out white! But that’s not all, folks! We have something very
special for the winner…”

\--------

Orange is in disbelief.

“A name? Really?”

“Mm-hmm!”, responds Kate. “From now on, every horse that wins gets a real name instead of just a color!”

“But I thought...we horses weren’t supposed to have names. That we were supposed to be defined solely by our victories.”

“Well...um, then think of your new name as a sort of trophy for your victory!”

“What about me?”, a voice interrupts. It’s yellow.

“Oh…” Kate pauses, unsure what to say. “Sorry, but anyone that won any previous races will have to win again to get a
name.”

Yellow seems disappointed, but she quickly shrugs it off.

“No worries. I’ll get my name soon enough!”

Orange clears her throat.

“So...what’s my name, then?”, she asks, nervously.

Kate unfurls the orange bundle she’s holding, revealing that it’s a new jersey for Orange. But instead of being blank,
it has three letters inscribed upon it: MRY.

Orange squints at it, unsure if she’s reading it correctly.

“My name is….MRY?”

“Um, it’s an abbreviation, sorry. Your new name is…” Kate turns the jersey over and reads off of the back:

“Jovial Merryment!”
