Super’s eyes slowly drift open.

*Where the hell am I?*, she thinks.

She looks straight ahead. A dark room, holding an indoor racecourse, dimly lit by blue and yellow LED strips. She looks
to her left. A series of starting gates all unoccupied. She looks to her right-

“Aaagh-!” a scream slips out, so startled Super is by the horse next to her. It’s white, just like her, but much bigger,
and something is...wrong with it. Its veins bulge as if they’re ready to rupture, and when it turns to face her, it has
a dead-eyed stare, like some sort of monster. Its jersey, white as snow, reads “AMF”.

“U-um…”, super squeaks out, “h-hi…?”

No response. It isn’t clear if this...this *thing* can even understand her words.

A blinding light suddenly fills the room. The starting light, lit up red. Super is startled by the sudden light, but the
mysterious figure next to her doesn’t even seem to notice. Then, a yellow light. Then, green, as the gates clatter open
like a cacophony of screams.

The mysterious figure takes off, leaving Super behind at the starting gate, dumbfounded at what’s happening.

*Well…guess I’m racing this thing*, white thinks as she takes off, using all her strength and quickly catching up to the
beast. As she passes it, she shudders, a haunting chill blasting through her spine. *At least it isn’t looking at me*,
she thinks just as it turns to face her, pitch black eyes and vacant grin burning into her vision.

The mysterious figure starts to pull ahead. Thinking quickly, Super rams into it with her shoulder as hard as she can,
knocking it off-balance.

*Holy shit, that thing’s heavy. My shoulder hurts…*

But, it worked. The figure was disrupted enough for Super to gain a lead. And now, the finish carrot is in sight.

It’s just one straight shot.

*I have to keep winning. I don’t know what that thing is, but I have a feeling I’ll find out the hard way if I don’t
win.*

A deafening clatter fills the room as Super crashes into the finish carrot at terminal velocity, tumbling to the floor,
hard. The beast racing behind her comes to a dead stop the moment it realizes it has lost, and it simply stares at her.
Super tries her best to look away from its unsettling gaze, bringing her hand to her face to hide a tear.

“L-lily?”, Super croaks weakly at the barren room as the figure stares, “A-are you there…? I’m scared…”

No one responds.
