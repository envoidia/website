\--------

“Ladies and gentlemen,” an announcer’s voice blares, “Meet the newest ponies vying to become champion of this year’s
Porekla Cup!”

A wrinkled, gray-haired woman sits in silence, smoking a cigarette and staring sternly at the television’s glow as it
permeates the otherwise dark room.

“First up is yellow and her handler, Alexis!”

Alexis tilts her glasses, smirking into the camera. Next to her, yellow smiles. A bright yellow bar appears at the
bottom of the screen, reading “Alexis is a 4-time Porekla Cup champion in just 5 years”.

“Next up is white and her handler, Lily!”

Lily clasps her hands together, smiling widely. Next to her, white puts on an approximation of a smile as best as she
can. A white bar at the bottom of the screen reads “Lily is an exciting newcomer to horse racing”

“And then we have blue and her handler, Iris!”

Iris smiles warmly into the camera, as blue stands next to her, staring off into space. A blue bar fades in at the
bottom of the screen, with the text “Iris has been handling horses for almost 20 years” adorned upon it.

“Last but not least, there’s brown and her handler, Valerie!”

Valerie’s short brown hair sparkles in the light of the twin suns as her equally brown eyes appear to pierce the camera.
Brown takes a deep breath beside her and puts on a smile.

\--------

Brown seems perturbed.

“Hey, why are we posing for this camera anyway?”

“Oh, I just wanted a picture to remember this by,” responds Valerie, smiling.

“Are you going to show it to people?”

“No, probably not. Why?”

“Just wondering.”

“Well, it’s time to wonder more about the race now, right?”

“...Yeah. I’m gonna win. You’ll see.” Brown strides towards the starting gate, where the others are already waiting.

“Hey brown!”, she hears someone call out as she nears the gate, “Nice to see you!”

She seems somewhat taken aback by this display of kindness, but quickly regains her composure.

“To you as well, yellow. May the best horse win.”

Yellow nods in agreement.

“Yeah...may the best horse win,” says white, somewhat weakly.

Blue remains silent.

Brown begins scanning the track. It’s almost a pentagon, but the loop isn’t completed, the final straightaway instead
bending into the center, where a large fake carrot stands. It’s difficult to see around the many sharp corners, but
she’d studied the track plenty of times before, and knew exactly where to go. But she also knew the others did as well.

The air grew still as time seemed to grind to a halt. Nothing could be seen except the horses, their handlers watching
from the sidelines, and the racetrack, dust sweeping across it with the winds, amber sunlight permeating the air.

Above the starting gate, a red light blinks on. All of the horses looked up at it in tandem. Then a yellow light. Then,
at last, a green one. The starting gates all burst open at once, and the racers were off.

\--------

“And yellow’s off to an early lead, followed closely by blue, then brown, with white lagging behind. No one knew what
she’s capable of, but maybe it’s not much, ha! Oh, but what’s this? Blue has shoved yellow onto the ground and taken the
lead! Things are getting violent already, folks!”

The old woman sighs, lighting another cigarette, her gaze never leaving the TV.

“Who hired this announcer? Back in my day, they were so much wittier.”, she proclaims to the empty room.

The woman watches in silence as yellow trips brown while she attempts to pass, and white manages to pass both of them as
they become preoccupied with shoving each other. For a moment, white manages to take the lead, an awestruck grin on her
face as she thinks she may be just about to do it...only for brown to catch up and trip her, blue and yellow both
zipping past her as her face hits the dirt. She doesn’t even bother getting up. She knows it’s over.

Yellow and blue reach the final straightaway at almost the same moment, matching each other step for step, meter for
meter. Neither will look at the other, only at the track ahead. They both know what has to be done.

For a moment, yellow begins to take the lead, but mere meters from victory, her stride begins to slow, her breath grows
ragged, sweat drips down her brow. She stumbles for a mere instant, and by the time she figures out what just happened,
blue has already knocked over the finish carrot.

“AND THE WINNER IS BLUE AND IRIS! What a close race that was folks, I had no idea who was gonna win right up till the
end there! After such an exhilarating game, I think we could all use a refreshing taste of the official soft drink of
the Pariqorum Horse Racing League, Wolf Cola, which has a flavor that’ll have you howling-”

The woman turns the TV off, shaking her head disapprovingly as she tosses a cigarette butt over her shoulder.

“What even was that? White just gave up, and the announcer wasn’t even narrating half of that. That wasn’t exciting at
all. This isn’t good enough.”

She sighs, pulls out her phone, and makes a call.

\--------

“See, I told you you could do it!” Iris squeals excitedly, beaming at blue. “C’mon, you gotta be proud of yourself now,
right?”

“Yeah, I guess I am,” blue closes her eyes, a neutral look on her face.

“When we get home, I’m gonna bake your favorite, carrot cake,” Iris tilts her head at blue, “How does that sound?”

Blue finally smiles. “That sounds great Handler, thank you.”

“No, thank you for winning for us!” Iris giggles, and blue laughs alongside her, albeit somewhat weakly.

\--------

“What the hell was that?”

“I’m sorry Handler, I-”

“Sorry doesn’t cut it, yellow!” Alexis rubs her forehead in frustration, “you need to try harder than that. Okay?”

“...Okay, Handler.”

“Let’s just go home. We’ll have to train a lot harder from now on.”

\--------

“Hi.”

White jumped, startled by Lily’s voice.

“Sorry, did I scare you?” Lily giggled.

“How long have you been sitting there?”

“Only a moment. Are you okay?”

“Take a guess. I lost.”

“You said you knew you were going to lose, but you seem a lot more upset now that it’s actually happened. If you really
always believed that, why does this upset you?”

“It’s just…” White sighed. “For a moment, I thought I actually had it. I was doing so well, and I blew it just like
everything else.”

“But don’t you see? You did so much better than you thought you would. That’s something to be proud of, even if you
don’t win.” White didn’t respond. “Let’s go home now, okay?”

After a moment that felt like an eternity, white silently got up and followed Lily home.

\--------

Brown looks around, searching for Valerie. Yellow and Alexis walk by.

“Hey,” says yellow, timidly. Brown’s head turns. “Sorry for tripping you back there. I just...really wanted to win.”

Brown turns away before responding.

“Don’t worry about it. We all wanted to win, and we should all do what we can to make that happen.”

“…Hey, where did your Handler go?”

“I think she went home without me when she realized I wasn’t gonna win. I’ll have to walk home myself.”

“That’s terrible!”

“Eh, I’m used to it. She’s always really busy, so…”

“Yellow…” Alexis’ voice suddenly cuts through the air. “You don’t need to fraternize with the other horses. Let’s get
home. I have a lot of words for you.”

Yellow takes a deep breath.

“Yes, Handler. I understand.”

Brown watches them walk away, leaving her alone in this large, empty field. She sighs, looking up at the clouds.

“Looks like it might rain soon...I’d better get home. Maybe I should’ve…no. I shouldn’t think about that.” She shakes
her head. “Who am I even talking to? The stress has me going crazy.”
