\--------

A lonely, windy plain. A run-down racetrack and abandoned bleachers. A stopwatch clicks.

“2:03.52”, a woman’s voice rings out. Disappointment can be seen in her sparkling green eyes as she sweeps her long,
curly red hair out of her face, marking notes on a clipboard in cursive. “I know you can do under two minutes. That’s
the least you’ll need if you want to win.”

A younger girl, looking 20 at the most, pants for breath on a nearby bench. She’s wearing bright blue running shorts and
a featureless blue jersey. Her hair is also blue, albeit a less saturated shade. She seems mostly normal, until you
realize she’s sporting horse-like ears and a tail, with fur the same shade of blue as her hair.

“I mean, seriously blue, your whole life has been leading up to this moment. You’ve been training since you were born
and yet it doesn’t seem like you really care about winning.” The woman is clearly upset.

“I know. I’m sorry,” blue sighs, panting between each word. “I just...why is this what I have to do?”

“What do you mean?”

Blue takes a while to answer. “...Nevermind.” She stands up, wobbling slightly before regaining her balance. “I think
I’m ready to go again. I’ll get it this time, I promise.”

\--------

Another girl with horse-like features, this one yellow, stares wistfully across the plain at the others in the distance,
wondering what they’re saying. But a stern voice snaps her out of it.

“What are you looking at, yellow?” The girl’s pitch-black hair reaches her shoulders. One of her eyes is green, the
other brown, but both give off an intense glint.

“Ah- sorry, Handler, I was distracted. It won’t happen again.”

“I should sure hope not. Worried about the other racers? Please. You just got a 1:54. No one can beat that. Be proud of
yourself. And me, of course, for training you so well.”

“You’re right,” yellow’s mood seems to perk up at this. “Thanks, Handler.”

Yellow flashes her Handler a cheerful smile. As she adjusts her glasses, she smiles back, though it’s more of a smirk,
evoking satisfaction at a job well done.

“Now let’s go home and get you some rest. The Porekla Cup is tomorrow, and you need to be rested to win that thing. And
then I’ll- you’ll be a champion.”

“Of course, Handler!”

\--------

As they walk away, blue watches them, the yellow hues of the setting sun reflected in her vibrant blue eyes as it sets.

“1:56.13 is incredible. Where were you hiding that?” The red-haired girl seems almost in awe.

“Thank you, Handler,” blue says flatly. Her mind is somewhere else.

“Hey, look more excited, will you? You can totally win this thing!” Blue’s handler smiles at her widely.

“Yeah. Yeah, I guess I can.”

“Guess I’ll have to be excited for the both of us, huh? Well, you’ve had a long day, so no wonder you’re tired. Privose
is already setting, and it’ll be way too dark out here if we wait for Crivose to set too. Let’s get you some rest,
champion!”

The yellow hues of the first sun give way as it slips behind the horizon, leaving only the dim red glow of Crivose to
illuminate the two as they walk home.

\--------

A white-haired horsegirl stands in her bedroom, trying to sleep, the dull red glow of the remaining sun tinting her so
fiercely red that you can barely tell what color her hair really is, lighting the room through the window overlooking a
forest just enough to see a solitary teardrop hit the floor.

“Handler, are you still there?”, she calls out, weakly.

A brown-haired girl pokes her head into the room, smiling at her, a glint in her pale green eyes.

“Of course, white. And you don’t have to call me Handler, you know. It’s too formal. Kinda icky.”

“Right. Lily, I…” White sighs as her horse ears, a bit larger than the others’, flop downwards in defeat. “I’m not going
to win. My first ever race is in just a few hours, and I’m nowhere near where I need to be.”

“I think you’ll surprise yourself if you just don’t give up. And no matter what happens, it’s okay. You just have to try
your best.”

“You don’t get it. I’ve been training my entire life for this, from the moment I was born. This has always been the only
thing in my life. It’d be one thing if I could put up a good fight but...you’ve seen what the others are capable of.”

“They have no idea what you’re capable of. Maybe you can psych them out by acting more confident.”

“Do you really think that’ll work?” White seems skeptical.

Lily shrugs.

“Worth a shot, right? You might as well take advantage of having a private racetrack to practice on.”

“Yeah...I’m the only one that doesn’t have to practice in public, and I still can’t get any faster than 3:10. That’s
like, a 2:20 or something at Widemeadow. Even brown got a 2:05 last night.”

“I wish I knew what to say,” Lily sighs, dejected. “Please just get some rest. You’ll feel better in the morning.”

As she leaves the room, she looks back towards white for a moment, almost as if she wants to say something, before
furrowing her brow and quickly turning away.

\--------

A brown-furred horsegirl stands in bed, her gaze drifting to an unlabeled box in the corner of the room before snapping
away, as if afraid to even look at it. She takes a deep breath.

“I can do this,” she whispers to herself, “If I can’t, I…”
