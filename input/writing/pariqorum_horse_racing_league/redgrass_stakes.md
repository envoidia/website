“I had to get up so goddamn early for this. What a pain,” Valerie glares at brown, “You better at least win this time.
Though I doubt if you even want to, considering-”

“I will do my best.”, brown interrupts, monotone, gazing into the sky.

“Yeah, whatever.” Valerie turns her beer bottom-up, then crushes the can and tosses it into the field. “Just don’t make
me regret letting you choose this path.”

“Um,” a small voice squeaks out, “please don’t litter…”

Startled, brown and Valerie turn to see a very short girl with long blonde hair and tired blue eyes, holding a
clipboard.

“The hell are you?”, Valerie exclaims indignantly.

The girl points at the name tag on her gray suit – it reads “Kate M.”

“Um, basically, I’m an official race organizer here to make sure everything is going smoothly, um, and I’m just saying
you shouldn’t litter.”

“Pfft,” Valerie is clearly not amused. “Your voice is as small as your stature. No wonder I don’t want to listen to
you.” She turns to brown. “Let’s go, brown. The race is starting soon and we can’t be wasting time here.”

As the two walk away, brown turns to Kate and mouths “sorry”. She passes by where Valerie’s can landed, and bends over
to pick it up, tossing it into a nearby garbage bin.

Kate simply stares at them as they leave, awestruck at how someone with such poor manners managed to end up a handler
for one of the most important racing circuits, until a voice from behind startles her.

“So why do we need to be babysat now when it was perfectly fine before?”

“Um, actually, Alexis, I was there before too...you just didn’t notice me.” As she speaks, Kate nervously takes a step
back. “Also, personal space, Alexis, please.”

Alexis gives Kate a terrifying fierce stare, as if she’s contemplating doing something terrible.

“My apologies. I’ll get out of your hair, miss organizer.” Alexis’ voice is curt and tart. As soon as she’s done
speaking, she strides away, motioning for yellow to follow her to the starting gate.

\--------

“First up we have blue and her handler Iris, winner of this year’s Porekla Cup, and naturally the favorite to win here
as well! Next, there’s the close second of yellow and her handler Alexis, followed by the underdog brown and her handler
Valerie! And of course, there’s white and her handler Lily, who gave up midway through her last race! You’d have to be
crazy to bet on her, am I right? But imagine how much it could pay off…”

The old woman sighs and reaches for a cigarette. Unable to find one, she slowly turns her eyes away from the TV,
spotting one that had dropped onto the floor. She bends over to pick it up.

“But of course, that’s not all we have for you today! We’ve also added three brand new horses into the mix! First of
these is cyan and her handler, Lydia! Then gray and her handler, Brooke!”

Hearing this, the woman sits up as quickly as she can, just in time to read the gray bar at the bottom of the screen:
“Brooke came out of retirement just for this”. Brooke’s eyes and hair are both the same shade of faded gray as the old
woman’s.

“That woman’s almost as old as me,” she exclaims, playfully, as she lights the cigarette.

“And finally, we have orange and her handler, Adelyn!”

Adelyn seems overdressed compared to the competition, wearing a dapper black suit, with shortly-cut bright silver hair
and blue eyes situated behind large-framed glasses. Orange stands beside her, visibly nervous.

\--------

As everyone converges on the starting gate, Adelyn side-eyes Valerie judgmentally.

“...Are you drunk?”, she asks, knowing the answer is yes but almost unable to believe it.

“Oonly a little…sho what if I am?”

“Nothing. I just find it interesting that you’re not taking this seriously.”

“Well I tried to, but- eh, whatever.” As Valerie stumbles away, she mutters quietly enough that it’s uncertain if anyone
else heard her, “You wouldn’t get it anyway.”

Adelyn hears someone giggling behind her. She turns and finds herself facing Lydia, whose hair is dyed cyan to match her
horse.

“What’s funny about that?” Adelyn’s gaze pierces Lydia’s warm brown eyes, but not too harshly, with more curiosity than
contempt, but still incredibly intense.

“Oh, I dunno, I just thought it was funny.”

“The integrity of the race being compromised by someone not taking it seriously is funny to you?”

“The way I see it,” the two girls turn to see Alexis sitting on the gate next to them, “That just makes things easier
for me. So I’m all for it.” She climbs down and walks towards where yellow is waiting for her, giving one last remark
before she leaves. “Besides, seems like her horse is taking it seriously at least.”

Just as everyone gets into position, the starting light lights up. Red. Yellow. Green. And they’re off.

\--------

“Looks like gray is in the lead, but cyan is catching up, with blue, the previous winner, falling behind. What an
unexpected start to the race! But still, anything can happen, and yellow’s taking the lead, perhaps trying to avenge her
previous loss by mere seconds, oh, but she’s slowing down and brown is catching up! Orange takes the lead as the racers
round the final bend...and suddenly cyan comes from behind, taking the lead out of nowhere on the final straightaway!”

\--------

Step after step, cyan draws ever closer to the finish carrot. Just a little further. Just a few more steps.

*This is it. This is what I have trained for. I will not be a failure. This is the only thing that matters, and I can
see it right in front of me. I just need to reach out and take it, and it will be mine*, she thinks.

Her heart flutters with anticipation as she realizes that she really is about to win. Time slows to a crawl. She has the
lead, and by a great deal at that, and her fingers are more milliseconds away from brushing up against the carrot. She
thinks of all the praise she’s going to get once she wins this. She finally made her Handler proud.

The carrot falls. The race is over. And of course, it was knocked over by the winner,

Yellow?!?

The pace of time returns to normal, everything a blur as cyan collapses into the dirt, almost blasting past the end of
the track. She was so, so sure that she had won. And yet, in the last moment, mere inches from the finish, it had been
taken away from her. She almost wants to cry.

*It’s okay*, she thinks, *I’ll have plenty more chances to win. Getting that close means I’m clearly capable.*

She grasps onto the fence at the edge of the track and pulls herself up, leaning on it to regain her breath for a moment
before walking away. Such a close loss frustrated her, but also filled her with confidence that she can win next time.

\--------

“Wow, that’s one of the most incredible comebacks I’ve ever seen! Cyan had such a huge lead, but somehow yellow caught
up and made up for the close loss she had in the Porekla Cup! The season has just started and already these games are
getting really exciting! After so much excitement, I imagine our racers are refueling with the most refreshing soft
drink there is-”

The TV turns off.

“Better,” the old woman mutters to herself, smiling gently.

\--------

Yellow picks up the large plastic finish carrot and hoists it onto her shoulders. Alexis sighs.

“Yellow, what are you doing?”

“As far as I know, there’s no rule that the winner isn’t allowed to just take the finish carrot,” she replies, “So if
I’m not gonna be getting an actual trophy, I’ll just take this.”

“You do know it’s not a real carrot, right?”

“Of course I know that. What do you think I am, stupid? I just want a trophy.”

“We don’t have room for that, yellow,” Alexis responds, clearly exasperated.

“Sure we do! I’ll just keep it in my room.”

“Fine.” Alexis realizes that she doesn’t have time to argue about this, and concedes. “But only this once. Now let’s go
home.”

“C-can you help me carry this? It’s kind of heavy…”

“No.”

Alexis walks away, yellow following as best as she can. Watching them go is white, who turns to Lily in awe.

“That’s not a real giant carrot???”

Lily giggles.

“No white, it isn’t.”

“Oh...sorry for being stupid.”

White seems crestfallen, though it’s clearly not just because of the carrot.

“Hey, you don’t have to be sorry for not knowing something,” Lily responds. White opens her mouth to say something, but
before she can, Lily continues, “And you also don’t have to be sorry for losing. You tried your best, and you’re getting
better.” She pauses for a moment, neither of them quite sure what to say, before getting up. “Let’s go home.”

White follows behind her, unable to look her in the eye the whole way home.
