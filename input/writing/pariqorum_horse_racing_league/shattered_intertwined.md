A twisted maze, barely lit at all, some parts shrouded entirely in darkness. Five horses, or perhaps more accurately,
two horses and three monsters. This is the race we’ve all been waiting for. The final race of this season of the
Pariqorum Horse Racing League.

In first place, Nighttime Knifemare. Second, A Mysterious Figure. Third, Jovial Merryment and Superstitional Realism
neck and neck, and dead last, Garbage Bin, possibly not even aware that it’s in a race, limping with an injured left
ankle.

“Merry,” pants Super, “there’s something I…have to tell you. These monsters…they…I think they were previous racers that
didn’t win enough.”

Merry is silent, focused only on the race, slowly beginning to pull slightly ahead of Super, who grasps her shoulder and
winces.

“Merry, I…I’ll let you win. I deserve whatever happens to me. …You’re better, anyway.”

Merry winces.

“I’ve…been cheating.”

“Wh-what? How?”, Super sputters, taken aback.

“Knob had…experimental steroids…she didn’t use them but I…made cyan steal them for me. I promised her I’d…help her win
someday in return.”

“I…promised her I’d help her win, too. But I guess it’s too late now.”

Merry turns her head back, looking behind her.

“Is it?”, she asks.

“Wh-what are you-”

“You said these things were racers that didn’t win enough. Doesn’t that one look an awful lot like cyan?”, Merry asks,
tilting her head at Garbage Bin, stumbling around far behind them.

“There’s no way. It can’t be her. It just…can’t.” Tears come to Super’s eyes. “Besides, if it is, it’s already too late
for her. You need to win so they don’t do that to you, too.”

“Don’t you get it? It’s not just about winning and losing. We are entertainment. Me winning all the time is…”, Merry
pauses to take a breath as her running slows, “going to get boring.”

Merry turns and looks Super dead in the eyes as she says her next words.

“We were made to get thrown away.”

Merry stops running, and turns to face Bin.

“Hey! Cyan! Do you…remember me?”

Bin doesn’t react.

“I-it’s me, Merry…don’t you…”

Merry jumps as a hand is placed on her shoulder. Super came back for her.

“It’s too late for her, Merry. We can’t do anything for her now.”

Merry nods silently, and after a moment, resumes running, Super close behind her. Merry runs faster than she ever has in
her entire life, heart pounding like a geyser of flame was lit beneath her. She quickly catches up to the nightmarish
creatures in the lead, and moves to one side to pass them. As she passes, their dark, lifeless eyes stare into Merry’s.
She shudders. The finish carrot is right there. All she has to do is make it a little further.

But instead, Merry turns back to face the beasts. Throwing herself at them, she fiercely punches at each of them, and
they retaliate in kind. They’re both much stronger than Merry. A kick in the face from Nighttime Knifemare breaks
Merry’s nose. In the chaos, A Mysterious Figure is able to slip by and continue towards the finish.

Super is about to touch the finish, to end all of this horror once and for all…and then, on a whim, she stops, turns
around, and tackles A Mysterious Figure with all of her body weight, knocking it onto the ground, where the two continue
to tussle.

Garbage Bin wanders into the vicinity of the fighting, looking around, expressionless as ever, but one can imagine that
it must have been confused.

“Merry…”, Super pants while fighting, “I know I said we can’t do anything now. But we can at least let her win.”

“Thank you…for helping me…”. Merry chokes out as she tussles with her opponent, battered and bloodied.

“Anytime…friend…” Super’s bones crack as A Mysterious Figure smashes her body against the floor, seemingly having
forgotten the race entirely.

“It’s an honor…to die with you…”, Merry whispers as a rush of blood leaks from her skull, and Nighttime Nightmare breaks
her arm, an emotion visible in its face for the first time – bloodlust.

Weakly, Merry moves her remaining arm and grasps onto Super’s hand. Her hand grasps back with the last strength she has.
The two monsters turn to see that Bin has wandered right up to the finish carrot and is simply staring at it, completely
still. They abandon their soon-to-be kills and race towards the finish, hoping to still claim it.

“Win…for me…don’t you remember me…cyan?” Merry coughs up blood between each word.

Bin looks Merry dead in the eyes. There’s something there. Suddenly, she turns and touches the finish, just as the
others are about to catch up to her. The final carrot clatters to the floor, the sound of its fall making itself known
even more deafeningly than it always does.

It’s finally over. This sick game has finally ended. For now. The ratings are through the roof, and the next season of
the Pariqorum Horse Racing League will have to find a way to top this.

But, for now, the room is still, two broken figures intertwined at the center in a pool of what was once their own life.
