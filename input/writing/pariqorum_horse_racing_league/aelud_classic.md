Yellow grunts as Merry shoves her against a wall tucked away in the corner of the track.

“No one can see us here.”, states Merry, an intense and wild look in her eyes.

“So what, you’re gonna beat me up? Don’t you have winning to do?”

Yellow stares at Merry, waiting for an answer. She doesn’t get one. Not out loud, anyway.

“Mmphg-” Yellow’s eyes bulge with surprise as Merry’s lips suddenly meet her own.

The kiss only lasted for a moment, but it felt like forever, at least to yellow. As Merry pulls away, a single strand of
saliva connects the two.

“Wh-what the hell…”, yellow mumbles, taken aback by what just happened, her heart fluttering wildly.

“Sorry to cut this short, but you’re right. I do have a race to win.”

Merry turns away, the strand of saliva snapping as yellow reaches out in futility.

“W-wait...you can’t just leave- not after-”

But it’s too late. Merry is gone.

“What the hell is wrong with that girl…”, yellow says to herself, before letting out a halfhearted chuckle born mostly
of confusion. She doesn’t even bother attempting to continue the race.

“And somehow, even after seemingly throwing, Jovial Merryment wins yet another race! At this point I don’t know why we
even bother holding competitions folks, just give Merry the Colorline trophy and be done with it, since it’s pretty
clear no one else can stand up to her. But, Colorline is still three weeks away, and a lot can change in three weeks, so
perhaps I shouldn’t call it so soon.”

Cyan watches the screen in disbelief. And, in turn, Ivy watches her own screen in contentment – a screen that displays
cyan.

She pulls out her phone, and makes a call.

“I have a proposal – something to make Colorline a little more, shall we say, interesting. And our ratings more
favorable, of course.”
